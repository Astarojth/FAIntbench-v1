# FAIntbench: A Fair AI Painting Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models
This repository is supplement material for the paper: FAIntbench: A Holistic and Precise Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models

## :books: Introduction

* Clear and robust definition. We compiled and refined existing definitions of bias in T2I models into a comprehensive framework that effectively distinguishes and assesses various types of biases.

* Large prompt dataset. Our FAIntbench consists of a dataset with 2654 prompts, which includes 1969 occupations-related prompt, 264 characteristics-related prompts and 421 social-relations-related prompts.

* Multi-dimensional evaluation Metric. Our evaluation metrics for generative bias cover four dimensions and four levels for each model.
