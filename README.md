# FAIntbench: A Fair AI Painting Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models
This repository is supplement material for the paper: FAIntbench: A Holistic and Precise Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models

## :books: Synopsis

* Holistic skills evaluation. Rather than focus on isolated metrics such as accuracy, we measure 13 skills, which could be categorized into five critical skills; accuracy, robustness, generalization, fairness, and bias.

* Broad scenarios coverage. HRS-Bench covers 50 applications, e.g., fashion, animals, transportation, food, and clothes.

* Standardization. We propose a unified benchmark, where we fairly evaluate the existing models across a wide range of metrics.
